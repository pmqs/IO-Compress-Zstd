FEEDBACK
--------

How to report a problem with IO-Compress-Zstd.

To help me help you, I need all of the following information:

 1. The Versions of everything relevant.
    This includes:

     a. The *complete* output from running this

            perl -V

        Do not edit the output in any way.
        Note, I want you to run "perl -V" and NOT "perl -v".

        If your perl does not understand the "-V" option it is too
        old. This module needs Perl version 5.004 or better.

     b. The version of IO-Compress-Zstd you have.
        If you have successfully installed IO-Compress-Zstd, this one-liner
        will tell you:

           perl -MIO::Compress::Zstd -e 'print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Zstd::VERSION\n]'

        If you are  running windows use this

           perl -MIO::Compress::Zstd -e "print qq[ver $IO::Compress::Zstd::VERSION\n]"

        If you haven't installed IO-Compress-Zstd then search IO::Compress::Zstd.pm
        for a line like this:

          $VERSION = "2.204" ;

 2. If you are having problems building IO-Compress-Zstd, send me a
    complete log of what happened. Start by unpacking the IO-Compress-Zstd
    module into a fresh directory and keep a log of all the steps

        [edit config.in, if necessary]
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
